## Introduction

Welcome to Project Vyasa!

The goal of this project is to provide a high-quality Sanskrit-English reader 
for the Mahabharata in a modern web interface.

Many excellent resources are freely available online 
(like [wisdomlib](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mahabharata-sanskrit)!)
but I've yet to find one that has all the following properties: 
- Word-by-word translation
- Detailed and accurate word-level grammatical explanation
- A minimal, easy-to-navigate, and clean web interface

Having stated the goal, it is equally important to mention that it is *not* the aim
of this project to provide anything more than a literally correct translation; 
that is, the included translations do not consider the broader cultural, historical, 
and philosophical context of the text.

The public website is [currently hosted here](https://projectvyasa.gatsbyjs.io/).

### An Example

Without further ado, here's an example of what the final product looks like.
*Note that although the screenshots here use Devanagari exclusively, the frontend*
*is also capable of rendering IAST with the push of a button!*

Verse Text:

Word by word breakdown and translation:

And finally, grammatical analysis in the form of a pop-out that appears on hover (or touch on mobile). 
Each word is broken down into its roots, which can be clicked to go to the corresponding dictionary entry:
